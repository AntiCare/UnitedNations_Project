# LoRa

LoRa (stands for a long range) is a technology of Internet of Things (IoT) developed by a company Cycleo. Nicolas Sornin, Olivier Seller and Francois Sforza – the three founders aimed to develop a long range, low power modulation technology. Since 2012 Semtech acquired Cycleo. [1]

LoRa is a chip that belong to a physical layer (of a wireless modulization) and supports IoT connectivity of LoRa based devices. This chip builds connection between remote end points, transfers its data to cloud, which allows businesses to make decisions based on real time data.
LoRa used so called a spread spectrum modulation technique which is derived from chirp spread spectrum technology. LoRa uses a license free frequency.
LoRa can be used to connect sensors, gateways, machines, devices, animals, people etc. wirelessly to the cloud. [2] For example parking sensors, motions sensors, soil moistures in farms, water meter, electric meter..

## Main features of Lora described by Semtech:
1.	Long range: range depends on many conditions
2.	Low power: requires minimal energy, battery lifetime is up to 10 years, minimum battery replacement cost
3.	Security: featured end to end- encryption, mutual authentication, integrity and confidentiality
4.	Standardization: device interoperability and global availability
5.	Geolocation: enables GPS-free tracking application
6.	Mobility: maintains communication with devices in motion without strain on power consumption
7.	High Capacity: supports million of messages per base station
8.	Low cost


# LoRaWAN
LoRaWAN (stands for a wide area network) is an open-source communication protocol. While LoRa is on a physical layer, LoRaWAN is covering the network communication on the network layer. Is it a software that is places on the LoRa chip to enable networking. LoRa Alliance®, a non-profit association drives the standardization and global harmonization of the LoRaWAN protocol.

# LoRa’s communication
LoRa based devices have a module that communicates to a locally central location called a gateway. The gateway lays between the sensor and the server. The network server communicates with the gateway via the internet and tells it how to interact with the sensor. LoRaWAN networks  together with Wi-Fi can optimize most of the IoT applications. [3]

# Facts
## Distance
In a typical LoRaWAN network, range depends on numerous factors—indoor/outdoor gateways, payload of the message, antenna used, etc. On average, in an urban environment with an outdoor gateway the expectations are 2 to 3 km wide coverage, while in the rural areas it can reach beyond 5 to 7 km.

## Amount of devices
A single LoRaWAN gateway can support 120 end devices, assuming each end device transmits 20 bytes every 16.7 minutes.

## Security
LoRaWAN is by design very secure. Authentication and encryption are mandatory, but networks and devices can be compromised if security keys are not kept safe, not randomized across devices or if cryptographic numbers used once (nonces) are reused, as is shown by numerous blog posts. [3]
